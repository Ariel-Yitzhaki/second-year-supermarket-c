# second-year-supermarket-c
My second‐year CS assignment is a console‐based supermarket manager in C. It uses a text menu to add products (with barcodes, prices, expiry dates), manage customers (including club members with discounts), and let customers fill shopping carts. All data is saved to files so you can load and continue later.
